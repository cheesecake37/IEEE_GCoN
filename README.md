Paper implementation for Symmetric Encryption Leveraging Euclidean Geometry for Resource Constrained IoT Devices. 
Abstractâ€”The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vital technology for connecting devices and systems, enabling smart decision-making, automation, and efficiency across industries. 
Its popularity continues to rise as it transforms everyday life, driving innovation in sectors such as healthcare, transportation, smart homes, etc. 
As IoT devices handle sensitive data, robust cryptographic solutions are necessary to secure data exchange against evolving cyber threats. 
At the same time, these resource-constrained devices need lightweight ciphers that balance security with efficiency. 
Symmetric ciphers such as RC-4, AES-128, and ChaCha20 have been widely adopted in IoT systems. However, these solutions often cause high computational overhead. 
In this paper, we introduce a novel symmetric cipher using Euclidean geometry. We implement the proposed scheme using real IoT devices. 
We show that our scheme provides security by causing lower computational costs compared to the state-of-the-art ciphers.
